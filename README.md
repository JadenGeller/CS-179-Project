# Parallel Nash Equilibrium Computation via Genetic Algorithm

## Abstract

I built a parallel genetic algorithm framework that resembles a modified version of the island model. The framework is built atop CUDA 7.5 and utilizes the experimental device lambda feature. Using this framework, I built a multiobjective optimization solver and determined its feasibility for Nash equilibrium computation.
